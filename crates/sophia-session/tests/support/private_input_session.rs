#![cfg(all(test, unix))]

//! Focused controls over Session's private input service.
//!
//! WHAT THESE ESTABLISH AND WHAT THEY DO NOT. These are lifetime and custody
//! controls: that a running service is visible as running, that stopping
//! collects it, that custody read after collection says so, and that a
//! controller which goes out of scope still stops and joins even while an
//! adapter holds the runtime. The wire proof -- committed surfaces, focus, keys
//! and pointer frames -- belongs to the acceptance rows and is not duplicated
//! here.
//!
//! FAULTS ARE RAISED AGAINST A SERVICE THAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING. A poisoned
//! lock or an exhausted bound means nothing if it is arranged before anything
//! exists to be damaged, so every control here connects a real peer over the
//! real socket first, and reads custody only after collection has happened.

// MOUNTED READ-ONLY AND NOT EDITED. This is the acceptance rows' own wire
// code; these controls use the part of it they need. The allowance is here
// rather than in that file precisely so it stays untouched: a fixture that
// exercises fewer of its frames than the acceptance rows do is not a reason to
// change it.
